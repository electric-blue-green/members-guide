#Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome to /r/MHoC!

/r/MHoC is a network of subreddits that work together to simulate how British politics works in a fun and enjoyable way.

It is centred around a network of subreddits, the two main ones being the two parlimentary chanbers, the Model House of Commons (/r/MHoC) and the Model House of Lords (/r/MHoL)

The community is headed by or head Moderator, /u/Djenial, alongside the Speaker of the House of Commons, /u/TheQuipton, and the Speaker of the House of Lords, /u/PurpleSlug

I hope this guide will give you all the information you need about how the Model Houses of Parliament works,  and on behalf of the Triumverate and the whole community, I would like to make you feel welcome to our vibrant and friendly community.
